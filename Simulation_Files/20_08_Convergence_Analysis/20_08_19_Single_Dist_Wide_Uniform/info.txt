This set of simulations was designed to test the convergence properties of a wide distribution.  
The properties were as follows:
Bounds: [4,4,1]
Distribution: Uniform between 0-1000 nm radii
Wavelengths: 2um-6um, 20 nm spacing
Fill Fractions: 0.2, 0.4
Number of distributions: 100

No special procedure is needed to execute this code.
