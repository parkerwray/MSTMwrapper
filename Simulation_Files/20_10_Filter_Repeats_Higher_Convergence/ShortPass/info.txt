This set of simulations was designed to test the quality of a ShortPass filter,$
The properties were as follows:
Bounds: [5,5]
Distribution: Custom (see end note)
Wavelengths: 2um-6um, 50 nm spacing
Fill Fractions: 0.4
Number of distributions: 25 

$he 20_07 optimization results folder, corresponding to	the ShortPass filter.
