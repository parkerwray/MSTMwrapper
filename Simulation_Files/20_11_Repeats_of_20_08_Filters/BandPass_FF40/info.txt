This set of simulations was designed to test the quality of a first-iteration band pass filter.  
The properties were as follows:
Bounds: [8,8]
Distribution: Custom (see end note)
Wavelengths: 2um-6um, 20 nm spacing
Fill Fractions: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
Number of distributions: 25

In order to execute this code, first import BandPass_Filter_40FF_Total_Workspace.mat, from the 20_07 optimization folder, and run without clearing variables.
