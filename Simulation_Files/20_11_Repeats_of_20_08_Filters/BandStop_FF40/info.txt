This set of simulations was designed to test the quality of a band-stop filter, with particle weights made using isolated data..  
The properties were as follows:
Bounds: [4,4]
Distribution: Custom (see end note)
Wavelengths: 2um-6um, 50 nm spacing
Fill Fractions: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
Number of distributions: 25

To execute this code, first import the total workspace matrix file from the 20_07 optimization results folder, corresponding to the BandStop filter.
